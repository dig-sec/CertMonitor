Here’s a sample `README.md` for your **CertMonitor** project:

---

# CertMonitor

**CertMonitor** is a Python-based application designed to fetch newly registered SSL certificates from certificate transparency logs (e.g., `crt.sh`) and store them in Elasticsearch. The application ensures consistency by keeping track of the last processed certificates to avoid re-fetching old data.

## Features

- Fetches newly issued SSL certificates from `crt.sh`.
- Stores certificates in an Elasticsearch index.
- Tracks the last processed timestamp to ensure no duplicate processing.
- Dockerized for easy deployment.
- Configurable via environment variables.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
- Access to an Elasticsearch instance.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/certmonitor.git
cd certmonitor
```

---

## Configuration

The application uses the following environment variables to configure its behavior:

| Variable                  | Description                                 | Default Value             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`      | Hostname or IP of the Elasticsearch server | `localhost`               |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`      | Port of the Elasticsearch server           | `9200`                    |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`     | Index name for storing SSL certificates    | `ssl_certificates`        |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_STATE`     | Index name for tracking fetch state        | `certmonitor_state`       |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME`  | Elasticsearch username (optional)          | `None`                    |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`  | Elasticsearch password (optional)          | `None`                    |

## Usage

### Running Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

### Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check Logs**

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f certmonitor
   ```

---

## How It Works

1. **Initial Run**:
   - Fetches certificates from the last 5 minutes.
   - Processes and stores them in the Elasticsearch data index.
   - Updates the last processed timestamp in the Elasticsearch state index.

2. **Subsequent Runs**:
   - Fetches certificates issued since the last processed timestamp.
   - Ensures no duplicates by checking against the state index.

3. **Periodic Fetch**:
   - Runs every 5 minutes to fetch and process new certificates.

---

## Elasticsearch Indices

### `ssl_certificates`
Stores the detailed SSL certificate data fetched from `crt.sh`.

### `certmonitor_state`
Tracks metadata about the fetching process, including the most recent timestamp.

#### Example Document in `certmonitor_state`
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-05T10:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Extending the Application

1. **Add New Sources**:
   - Modify `fetch_ssl.py` to integrate additional sources like Let's Encrypt or other transparency logs.

2. **Add Notifications**:
   - Integrate with Slack, email, or webhooks to notify about newly added certificates.

3. **Optimize Elasticsearch Mappings**:
   - Update index mappings for `ssl_certificates` to optimize search and retrieval.
